              As a musician, my ultimate goal was to make a powerful impression

              My interest in software engineering began some years ago as a
              hobby, building simple Unity games or designing websites for
              friends. The enjoyment of building software soon became something
              of an obsession, so much so that I decided to make a career
              transition.{" "}

              As a former classical violinist I have played with some of the top
              orchestras in the world, and am used to high-pressure,
              high-performance environments. It's also an industry where
              personal study and learning never stop. Click the play button to
              hear a sample of my work as a violinist.{" "}

              software engineering.
