              As a musician, my ultimate goal was to make a powerful impression
              on an audience. Iâ€™m striving to achieve the same thing as a
              developer, by building software that makes an impact. My interest
              in software engineering began some years ago as a hobby, building
              simple Unity games or designing websites for friends. The
              enjoyment of building software soon became something of an
              obsession, so much so that I decided to make a career transition.
              As a former classical violinist I have played with some of the top
              orchestras in the world, and am used to high-pressure,
              high-performance environments. It's also an industry where
              personal study and learning never stop. I hope to bring the same
              passion and dedication to my new career in software engineering.
